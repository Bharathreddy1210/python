     * = Mathematical operator
     'hello' = values (string)
     -87.8 = Values (integer)
      '-'  = Mathematical operator
      '/'  = Mathematical operator
      '+'  = Mathematical operator
      6    = values (integer)

2. string : It is data type used for data values, made up of ordered sequences of characters.

   Variable : A variable stores the information, which can be from strings to numbers.


3.  Numbers : It stores the numeric values.Three different numerical types
                1. Int (signed numbers)
                2. float (floating point real values)
                3. Complex (complex Numbers)

    string : A contiguous set of characters represented in the quotation marks.

    List : Lists are enclosed with the square brackets. It acn store different form of data types ( int, char, float, complex).

  4. An expression is combination of values, variables, operators and operands that is interpreted to produce some other value.

  5. A statement is an instruction that an python interpreter can excute and displays the result
     whereas, expression is combination of symbols that represent a value.

  6.   bacon  = 23
 
  7. Both the values shows the same result ' spamspamspam '
 
  8. Variable names cannot begin with a number.
  
  9. int(), float() and str() can be used to get the three versions.
  
  10. Only strings can be concatenated. we can use inverted commas.
